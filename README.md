<div>
                <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to our employee directory single-page application. This app is built with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code</li>
                    <li>React for client-side code</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap for layout and styling</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Project description</h3>
                <p>A new project to build an online directory for the company. There's an existing API that can feed you the data that can be accessed at this URL: <a href='https://reqres.in/' target='_blank'>https://reqres.in/</a></p>
                <p>The goal is to be able to fetch the data from the api and display a list view, with a link to display a more detailed page with the employee&#8217;s information. Because the company is large, we&#8217;ll need to be sure we can paginate the list results and also search by email address to find that one specific person.</p>
                <p>This is a Greenfield exercise, and you&#8217;re in charge. Please choose your desired technology to make this happen. This does not have to be pretty, it is an exercise to learn how you would approach the problem, how you collaborate with our team members, how you accept feedback, and how you can explain the choices you&#8217;re making.</p>
                <br />
                <p>**There is only 1 rule. You cannot call the API directly from the frontend.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start a new repository with the desired tech stack. Implement a method of fetching the data from the API on the backend and serving to the frontend</li>
                    <li>Display a paginated list view of the results of employees</li>
                    <li>Provide a link to go to a page to display more details about a specific employee</li>
                    <li>Ensure that users can enter an email address to help narrow down the employee list closer to the person they are looking for</li>
                </ul>                
            </div>
